python -c "
import sys
sys.path.append('.')
from ci_cd.ci_integration import CICDIntegration

print('🔔 GITHUB ACTIONS ANNOTATIONS DEMO')
print('=' * 45)

ci = CICDIntegration('github_actions')

print('GitHub Actions Annotations:')
ci.set_error('Security vulnerability found in S3 bucket configuration', 'main.tf', 15)
ci.set_warning('Instance type t2.micro may not be suitable for production', 'ec2.tf', 8)
ci.set_notice('Infrastructure deployment completed successfully', 'outputs.tf', 1)

print()
print('📝 These annotations appear in GitHub Actions:')
print('   ❌ Errors: Red annotations in Files tab')
print('   ⚠️  Warnings: Yellow annotations with suggestions') 
print('   ℹ️  Notices: Blue informational messages')
print('   🎯 Line-specific: Point directly to problematic code')
