python demo_cicd.py
```
**What it does:**
- Shows you exactly what CI/CD does
- Runs the same tests as GitHub Actions
- Lets you choose what to test
- Explains everything step by step

### 2. 📚 Learn About CI/CD
```bash
python demo_cicd.py --explain
```
**What it shows:**
- What CI/CD means in simple terms
- When it runs automatically
- Why it's helpful for beginners
- Real-world benefits

### 3. 🌐 Real GitHub Actions (Push to GitHub)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added simple CI/CD"
git push
```
**What happens:**
- GitHub automatically runs tests
- You see results in "Actions" tab
- No manual work needed!

## 🎯 Demo Flow (What You'll See)

### Interactive Demo Steps:
```
🚀 STEP 1: Check Environment
   ✅ Verify AWS credentials
   ✅ Check LocalStack status

🚀 STEP 2: Static Analysis  
   ✅ Scan for security issues
   ✅ Validate Terraform syntax

🚀 STEP 3: Policy Compliance
   ✅ Check organizational rules
   ✅ Generate compliance score

🚀 STEP 4: Dynamic Testing (Optional)
   🐳 Start LocalStack (safe testing)
   🧪 Deploy and test infrastructure
   ✅ Validate everything works
